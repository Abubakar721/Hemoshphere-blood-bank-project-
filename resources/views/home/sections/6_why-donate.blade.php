      <h2>Why Should You Donate Blood?</h2>
      <p>
        Donating blood is a selfless act that has the power to save lives.
        Here are a few reasons why you should consider donating blood: ― You
        could help save up to three lives with just one donation. ― Blood is
        always needed in emergency situations, such as natural disasters and
        accidents. ― Blood is needed for patients undergoing surgeries, cancer
        treatment, and other medical procedures. ― Blood cannot be
        manufactured, which means that the only source of blood is through
        donations from volunteers. ― Donating blood can also have health
        benefits for the donor, such as reducing the risk of heart disease and
        cancer.
